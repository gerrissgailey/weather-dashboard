# Weather Dashboard

This project was designed to serve as a weather dashboard web app. 

## Features & Functionality

- Location search bar to search either by US city or US zip code.

- Search results which display both current day weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. Results will also pull a weather condition icon.

- Search history sidebar which allows for easy selection of previous location searches without having to re-type the location in the search bar. This history can also be cleared with the 'Clear History' button.
